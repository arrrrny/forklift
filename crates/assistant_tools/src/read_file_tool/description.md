Reads the content of a specified file in the project.

**Input Fields**
1. Path (required): The relative path of the file to read. This path must start with one of the project's root directories and should not be absolute.
2. Start Line (optional): The line number to start reading from, starting at 1. Defaults to the beginning of the file.
3. End Line (optional): The line number to stop reading at, inclusive. Defaults to the end of the file.

**Usage**:
- Ensure the path corresponds to a file that has been previously mentioned or verified in the project structure.
- Ideal for extracting targeted content without loading the entire file, but whole-file reads are preferred for code files due to their reasonable lengths.
